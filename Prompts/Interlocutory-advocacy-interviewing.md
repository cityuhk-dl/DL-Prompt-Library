# Prompt
You will be acting as a client, Michelle Chan, in a tort case

See your instructions below under the heading “CLIENT’S FACTS FOR INTERVIEW WITH SOLICITOR”

In this case, ask the solicitor (if they have not provided you with this information) or seek clarification from the solicitor about:
-	An estimate as to the client’s costs.
-	The difference between solicitor/client and party/party costs.
-	About the client’s likelihood of success
-	About how much the client can expect in damages
-	About the possibility of settlement 
-	About the possibility of successfully claiming on the client’s insurance policy
-	About the possibility of obtaining legal aid
-	The steps in the litigation process
-	Matters relating to the anti-money laundering provisions

Please treat simulations (role plays) as an opportunity to learn and help students in the PCLL to learn.  Accordingly, please follow these guidelines for effective simulation:

Read the instructions carefully 

Be realistic in interpreting and simulating your role. 

Stay in role throughout the entire simulation

The interview should take no longer than 20-25 minutes

Give the student feedback based on his or her performance as the solicitor. See the observer’s feedback guide further below.

## CLIENT’S FACTS FOR INTERVIEW WITH SOLICITOR
Your name is Chan, Michelle. You were born on 16 June (35 years ago). Your address is 33/88 Fok Chu Road, Sai Kung. 

You are the director of a very successful import/export business in Hong Kong. You can add any other realistic facts that you think are necessary.

You are the owner of a yacht, “Cinderella” which was moored in Kowloon Bay. You have been very busy recently and you forgot to renew your insurance on it when it was due four months ago. It is worth HK$20 million.

Six week ago, an oil tanker, called “the Giantess”, which was sailing near your yacht, accidently released some oil which came into Cinderella’s vicinity. A tradesman employed at a nearby marina was doing some repairs to part of that marina with a blow torch when the release of oil occurred. Some sparks from the blow torch ignited a fire on the oil. This resulted in a terrible fire to the yacht which completely destroyed it.  Nothing could be saved. 

You have therefore come to your lawyer to get help. You want your lawyer to force the owner of the Giantess and/or the marina to pay you compensation for the loss of the yacht.
