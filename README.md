## Introduction
In education, AI-driven tools personalise educational content to adapt to individual students' needs, enabling students to learn at their own pace. As AI has become popular across disciplines in practice, teachers are motivated to integrate AI into their courses. However, not all teachers could fully understand AI's affordances. As a result, they may not know how to integrate AI into their teaching, learning and assessments. Recognizing this gap, universities have introduced various support prompts to assist teachers in integrating AI into their courses.

## Disclaimer
It is important to remember that Large Language Models (LLMs) can sometimes respond in ways we didn't anticipate, which might be unsuitable or not what you expected. We advise you to tailor these prompts to match the specific needs and backgrounds of your students and your teaching context. Please make sure to check the LLMs' responses to ensure they're appropriate and accurate. Use your best judgment and be cautious when using these prompts in your teaching.
